# Phoenix Services Backend

# Phoenix
[Phoenix Framework](http://phoenixframework.org/) leverages the Erlang VM ability to handle millions of connections alongside Elixir's beautiful syntax and productive tooling for building fault-tolerant systems.

The Phoneix Services Backend manages all communications with our [Electron Frontend](https://github.com/turbo-play/frontend). Our Phoenix Services Backend currently communicates & relays with our [eWallet Backend](https://github.com/turbo-play/ewallet) as well as our [Blockchain Services Backend](https://github.com/turbo-play/blockchain-services).

All source code is released as is under the Apache v2 licensing.

# Setup

To setup the Phoneix Services Backend you will need to configure your services.

  adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres,
  username: "postgres",
  password: "",
  database: "app_api_dev",
  hostname: "app_api_db",
  pool_size: 10
```

## Configure your eWallet API Access:
````
config :app_api, ewallet: [
    base_url: "http://ewallet:4000/",
    api_key: "",
    access_key: "",
    secret_key: ""
